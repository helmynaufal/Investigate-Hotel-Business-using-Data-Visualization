# Investigate Hotel Business using Data Visualization
In this project, I analyze the business performance in the hospitality sector, focusing on how customers behave on making hotel bookings and how this relates to the cancellation rate of hotel bookings. I use python to analyze the data.

I create this project through several steps:

## 1. Data Preprocessing
First, I check whether the data have a null value or not. I found some columns have null values and filled that with some values. Then, I checked the values in categorical columns and I replace similar values. Last, I aggregate some columns and drop the unused columns.

## 2. Monthly Hotel Booking Analysis Based on Hotel Type
Here, I found that the data datetime is a bit strange, so I correct the datetime. Then I create a plot that shows the total hotel bookings each month based on hotel type.

## 3. Impact Analysis of Stay Duration on Hotel Bookings Cancellation Rates
I checked the distribution data of customer stay duration. Then I aggregate some values that have low density. Then create a visualization that shows the comparison of cancellation rates in each customer stay.

## 4. Impact Analysis of Lead Time on Hotel Bookings Cancellation Rate
I checked the distribution data of lead time and found that it has a wide range. So, I categorized the value to make it easier to interpret the data. Then create a visualization to compare cancellation rates in each lead time category.
